# Fake_News_Predictor
A MACHINE LEARNING MODEL THAT CLASSIFIES NEWS ARTICLES AS REAL OR FAKE USING BERT-BASED TEXT CLASSIFICATION. IT AUGMENTS THE DATASET WITH GPT-2-GENERATED FAKE NEWS AND REAL NEWS FROM NEWSAPI TO IMPROVE MODEL PERFORMANCE.

Fake news detection has emerged as a critical field of research. Traditional methods for verifying news rely on human fact-checkers, which are time-intensive and impractical for large-scale analysis. Automated solutions have gained prominence due to advancements in machine learning and NLP. Techniques such as BERT, transformers, and synthetic data generation have shown promise in understanding the semantic nuances of language, which is crucial for identifying misinformation. This project builds on these developments by incorporating modern methodologies and tools.

Our objectives when carrying out this project were:

- Develop a machine learning model capable of detecting fake news with high accuracy.
- Create a balanced dataset comprising real and fake news using both publicly available databases and synthetic data.
- Integrate a BERT-based architecture for superior contextual understanding.
- Deploy an API-driven system for real-time news classification.
- Provide a user-friendly interface to facilitate easy interaction with the model.
